"# endpoints" 

This is a springboot back end service that exposes endpoints for conversions.
After downloading and starting the application in the ide of your choice or via cmd.
Open swagger on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html and click amount-controller
and select the conversions you want to make and click tryout and type the amount
and you'll see the response.

For logging execution time per api call I have added LoggingAspect.java class and it
displays how long each call takes to complete.
